\section{Introduction}

There are number of engineering applications that instigate practical and fundamental interest in fluid flows at micro and nano scales, in energy management (e.g. miniaturised heat exchangers for electronic cooling \cite{yarin2009boiling}), in health (e.g.for lab-on-a-chip diagnostic devices \cite{jiang2011microfluidic}), purification processes (seawater desalination \cite{mattia2008static}, air purification \cite{mantzalis2011filtering}). In the general engineering view, they constitute the transport flows in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) which has plethora of applications across aerospace, biology, instrumentation. These fluid flows are characterised by length scales between $100\;nm$ to $100\;\mu m$. In classical fluid dynamics the assumption is that the geometry-based macroscopic length scale is significantly larger than the mean-free-path of the molecules. Hence, the fluid is treated as a continuum. In the micro and nano flow regime, the discrete nature of fluid molecules emerges and the Knudsen number describes the extent to which the fluid departs from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. These changes are noticed earliest near the fluid-solid or fluid-liquid interface due to the nature of boundary forces. The gas molecules near the interface are not in translational equilibrium until a few mean free lengths from the interface. This results in a discontinuity in the flow characteristics of the gas, namely, velocity slip and temperature jump. These discontinuities are commonly termed as rarefaction effects and denote the emergence of the molecular nature of the flow in the classical continuum. The varying physics of the flow with the length scales of the setup can be quantified by the Knudsen number,
\[ Kn = \frac{\lambda}{L} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2\theta}}\frac{\mu}{\rho L}\;\]
where $\lambda$ is the mean free length, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\theta$ is the temperature in energy units, $\rho$ is the density and $L$ is the characteristic length scale. Representing $\lambda$ and $L$ in terms of Mach number$(Ma)$ and Reynolds number$(Re)$ respectively, 
\[ Kn = \frac{Ma}{Re}\sqrt{\frac{\pi \gamma}{2}},\;\]
where $\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats of the gas. Due to the high surface-to-volume ratio in these setups, the viscous forces of the fluid become high enough as compared to the inertial forces. This strongly limits the Reynolds number of the flow as it is the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces. Based on the degree of rarefaction the fluid flow are classified in regimes as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Continuum/Hydrodynamic regime $(Kn\leq 0.01)$ : The non-equilibrium effects are negligible and NSF equations model the fluid physics accurately.
    \item Slip flow regime $(0.01\leq Kn\leq 0.1)$ : NSF equations coupled with the temperature jump-velocity slip boundary conditions model the flow.
    \item Transition regime $(0.1\leq Kn\leq 10)$ : NSF equations fail to model the flow accurately and the gas requires to be detailed at a more discrete level. The flow is governed by Boltzmann model or by extended macroscopic models.
    \item Free molecular regime $(Kn\geq 10)$ : Inter-particle interactions are negligible and the flow is dictated by wall-particle interactions.
\end{itemize}

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kinetic theory models the physics of the gas accurately irrespective of the degree of rarefaction but the high dimensionality of the equation makes obtaining the numerical solution prohibitively expensive. The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Method (DSMC) (\cite{bird1994}) is a stochastic method used for simulation of dilute gas flows at a molecular level. Similarly, simulation tools based on the kinetic theory of gases have been introduced by Wu et al.\cite{wu_reese_zhang_2014} and Naris \& Valougeorgis \cite{nargis}. Even though the DSMC method allows for useful solutions, it still is many times more computationally expensive than continuum computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, because the number of particles is high in the slip-flow regime.\par
In lieu of this, continuum equations derived from moment approximations provide a compromise to model the transition and slip-flow regime practically. The macroscopic properties of density, temperature, pressure, etc. are weighted integrals over the phase density. Towards that objective, Grad introduced the method of moments (\cite{grad1}, \cite{grad2}), which involves approximating the phase density of the gas over a set of Hermite polynomials. With similar moment methods, we can obtain different sets of moment equations tailored to specific flow regimes and physics. Torrilhon and Structrup (\cite{r13one}) %pull references from the JCP2013 paper
presented a set of what is known as R13 moment equations, derived from an asymptotic expansion of the Boltzmann equation which capture rarefaction effects with good accuracy. The range of Navier Stokes equations can also be extended by considering non-linear contributions to heat flux and stress based on the results of Rational Extended Thermodynamics(RET)(\cite{Muller_1993}). This results in the Coupled Constitutive Relations Model (CCR) introduced by Rana et al.(\cite{rana_ccr}). The CCR model is shown to capture rarefactions effects including but not limited to thermal stress, heat flux in absence of temperature gradients and the Knudsen paradox.\par
As mentioned earlier these moment equations allow for CFD methods to be used for numerical solutions for rarefied gases. The most common CFD methods are the finite volume (FVM), element (FEM) or difference (FDM) methods. FVM starts with integrating the PDEs over the cell volume and converting the divergence terms to surface integrals, using the Gauss Divergence Theorem. The imposition of conservation within the scheme is one of the primary reasons for FVM to be a powerful method for fluid analysis. As the approximations is based on the cell connectivity in the mesh, FVM works for unstructured meshes as well. For a detailed reference, readers are referred to Moukalled et al\cite{Moukalled_2016}.
Gu and Emerson\cite{GU-Emer-fvm} presented a computational strategy to apply conventional elliptic-based FVM to the moment equations. Here, an intermediate approximation is required to reframe the moment equations in the diverging form. This results in the loss of this method's applicability over a large range of Knudsen numbers.The FVM methods are also limited to high Mach number. Torrilhon\cite{mt_siam} developed a FVM scheme based on Harten-Lax-van Leer flux limiters for the R13 moment equations with demonstrated accuracy for shock bubble interactions. When solving the moment equations with FVM, the primary challenge that has to be addressed is the absence of explicit expressions of divergence transport terms in the momentum and energy equations and hence techniques native to hyperbolic equations are usually required. This increases the complexity and computational expense of the method to a large degree. FEM first converts the partial differential equation into their \textit{weak/integral formulations}. Westerkamp and Torrilhon \cite{WESTERKAMP20191} developed a FEM solver for linearised R13 equations coupled with a continuous interior penalty method, which increases the robustness of the numerical method. Meena et al.\cite{MEENA2017370} have presented a scheme combining the Discontinuous Galerkin methods with fluxes calculated using FVM for 10-moment Gaussian closure equations where a limiter is required to preserve positivity of density. FEM is suitable for curved geometries but operationally slow and expensive.\par
Finite difference methods are popular due to the ease of implementation and the low computation cost and time required. It is achieved by using different formulations of the Newton's Finite Difference formulae for the approximation. The accuracy is dependent on the number of nodes are used to approximate the differential terms. Because this scheme directly converts the PDEs into a system of $[A][X]=[b]$ with a sparse collocation matrix, $[A]$, instead of requiring flux approximations, reformulation and polynomial basis like FVM and FEM does, FDM is considerably faster than the two former methods. As the conservation is not implicitly imposed with the scheme, the accuracy can be lesser as compared to FVM and FEM in some cases. FDM is generally limited to Cartesian grids because the non-orthogonality can introduce unphysical solutions\cite{Ferziger_2002}. However, the problem can circumvented to a degree by using the special methods for weight calculations and imposing flux conservation explicitly; these methods are termed as Generalised Finite Difference Methods(GDM). Zhen et al.\cite{zhen2021novel} developed a Finite Difference method for Euler equations on unstructured grids based on WENO (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory) scheme. Rana et al.\cite{RANA2013169} presented a central difference scheme approach towards solving the non-linear R13 moment equations with significant accuracy but their approach was limited to a structured mesh on a square lid-driven cavity. Also, with a structured mesh on a curved domain, spatial transformations and mapping increase the complexity of the already highly non-linear governing equations and boundary conditions. Hence, methods that can solve the equations in the intrinsically within the curved mesh are highly desired when using finite differences. [Insert stuff about generalised finite difference methods] \par
Considering the relative properties of the above methods, the present work aims to present a numerical method based in finite difference, because of low computational cost and easier scaling, while incorporating the positive features of other methods. Local shape functions are used for field approximations, which translate the information of the geometry to the numerical solution and hence helps in establishing a scheme impervious to geometry and refinement variations. Special care is taken to incorporate the mass conservation constraint in the scheme. As a result, a computational inexpensive numerical scheme is provided to solve the CCR model that provides robust solutions for a complicated set of governing equations and boundary conditions.
